Hi,
My program is about counting number of appearance of the text from files. 
It compiles a program that will accept 0 to n command line arguments, or from standard input (using the bash pipe operator) for analysis, or
the provided files for analysis. I read each symbol in a file and concatinate it in a pointer everytime until an invalid symbol appear,
which indicate it is the end of the word and add it to a linked list. The linked list (a char pointerm, an int counter, and next reference) 
is used for storing all the words and counting them. I only use system calls for input and output as required, no unsed variables. 
I provide error checkings for every system call and library call. I free the malloc() variables I create. And I format the words printed out on the screen.
It might take a little bit long for my program to run since I use linked list struct    ure, but I tested and saw the correct results.

Thank you and have a great day.
